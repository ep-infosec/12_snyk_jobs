We're looking for a proactive, curious person to join our Customer Success team to provide technical support to the developers who use Snyk.

**Snyk's mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure.** The use of open source is booming, but [security is a key concern](https://snyk.io/stateofossecurity/). Our product enables developers and enterprise security to find & fix vulnerable dependencies, without slowing down development. Snyk integrates seamlessly into developer workflows so that security becomes business as usual.

Over 100,000 developers depend on Snyk to keep their software secure. We have many large organisations on board, including Google, New Relic, and ASOS, and we are growing rapidly.

### Your role

You'll talk to active and prospective Snyk customers every day. You’ll join our small Customer Success team, and you’ll work directly alongside our talented engineering team to help solve the most complex issues.

**You'll spend your time:**
- answering our users’ questions through email, chat, and GitHub issues;
- understanding, reproducing and (where you can) resolving the issues that our customers encounter;
- diving into our logs and our codebase to figure out where the issue lies and what a good solution might look like;
- for tricky issues, filing tickets for our engineering team to resolve;
- ensuring that every user facing an issue knows exactly when they’ll hear back from us and how we’re doing with solving their problem;
- listening to our users’ needs, keeping track of recurring requests, and representing their voice in product prioritisation discussions;
- improving our support processes, so that as we continue to grow we can keep providing prompt and delightful service.

As the main point of contact for our customers, you’ll play a critical role in building and maintaining their trust. You will need to balance the needs of our enterprise customers with those of our self-service online users, so that we can build a sustainable business while also contributing to the open source community.

You’ll have the opportunity to shape what best-in-class technical support looks like, and to help us get there. That could be through writing customer documentation and FAQs, or developing your technical skills by working on tooling for the Customer Success & Support team, for example dashboards or integrations between tools we already use (like Slack, Hubspot, and Jira).

Over time, we’d love for you to lead the support aspects of our Customer Success team, or to transition into a developer role in the broader company.

### You should join us if:

- You love helping people, and care deeply about providing an excellent customer experience.
- You take a logical approach to solving problems and prioritisation.
- You are a clear communicator, both verbally and in writing, and you enjoy explaining things to others.
- You’re interested in developing your technical skills: you’re excited about working with others’ code, and you have used GitHub or other source control tools.
- You have previous experience working closely with technical teams. Perhaps you’ve provided support for a technical product, worked in QA, or are taking your first steps to becoming a software engineer.
- You are curious: you love to explore new challenges, but know when you need guidance from someone with more domain experience.
- You’re interested in security or open source software, and you believe in our mission.

We’d love it if you’ve worked with JavaScript before, or have already [tried out our product](https://snyk.io/test), but neither of these are necessary: we’re happy to teach you.

### Interested?

Please apply [here](https://grnh.se/uput8fap2).

We value diversity at Snyk, and would particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this role, but are not totally sure whether you’re the right person, please apply anyway!
